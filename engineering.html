            <p> What follows is a list of my personal projects. This list is 
                ordered from most to least recent.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Satellite Sonnet</strong> &mdash; Application that generates a daily 
                    Shakespearean sonnet about NASA's astronomy image of the day using AWS Lambda. 
                    The application uses NASA's public API to get the day's image, encodes the 
                    image into byte blocks, and sends the information to Anthropic's Claude for 
                    sonnet generation. The result is cached into DynamoDB to minimize further API 
                    calls. Upon users visiting the site, an atomic counter is incremented (using 
                    AttributeAction.ADD) to inform users of what "visitor number" they are. You 
                    can see <a href="https://alexdean.io/satellite-sonnet/">the website</a>, the 
                    <a href="https://github.com/alexjdean/satellite-sonnet">frontend code</a>, and 
                    the <a href="https://github.com/alexjdean/satellite-sonnet-backend">backend code</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Write and Compare</strong> &mdash; Anki add-on that provides the Write 
                    and Compare note-type, allowing users to write multi-line answers to Anki cards
                    and test their knowledge in a more active format. Instead of passively reviewing 
                    a card, this note type forces users to write down their answer for the question the 
                    card is posing, resulting in slower and stickier learning. You can see the 
                    <a href="https://github.com/alexjdean/anki-write-and-compare">GitHub page</a> and 
                    <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1148161821">AnkiWeb add-on</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Generative Documentation & Testing</strong> &mdash; NPM package that 
                    functions as a CLI tool using the GPT 3.5 API to improve your JavaScript and 
                    TypeScript code. It helps you write better code by automatically generating 
                    documentation, refactoring code to improve performance and maintainability, 
                    adding unit tests using Jest, and converting JavaScript code to TypeScript. 
                    At its peak, the package had about 700 weekly downloads. You can see the 
                    <a href="https://github.com/alexjdean/type-scriptor">GitHub page</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Generative Satire</strong> &mdash; Automated satirical news site monitoring 
                    recent events and generating Onion-style articles using LLMs; At its peak, 
                    the site had a viewership of about 1500 people per week. The application was 
                    built using a React frontend and a Node.js backend, with articles stored on a 
                    Firebase Realtime Database and multiple APIs used for image and content 
                    generation. The site is hosted on Google Cloud. You can see the 
                    <a href="https://chicagomoontimes.com/">website</a> and the 
                    <a href="https://github.com/alexjdean/chicagomoontimes.com">GitHub page</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Read This to Me</strong> &mdash; Application that converts written text into 
                    audio from a wide variety of dialects, using the SpeechSynthesis Web API. The 
                    site was built using JavaScript and HTML/CSS. The site is hosted on GitHub 
                    Pages with a custom domain. You can see the 
                    <a href="https://readtext.me/">website</a> and 
                    <a href="https://github.com/alexjdean/readtext.me">GitHub page</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Language Discovery</strong> &mdash; Application that applies various 
                    similarity algorithms on various human language data sets. By languages, 
                    I'm referencing frequency dictionaries for human languages, which catalog 
                    how frequently a word is used in one language relative to another. I examine 
                    topics like the average word length and the most popular color in a given 
                    langauge. You can see the 
                    <a href="https://alexdean.io/language-discovery/vis/index.html">website</a> 
                    and <a href="https://github.com/alexjdean/language-discovery">GitHub page</a>.
