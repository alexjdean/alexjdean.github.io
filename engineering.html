            <p> What follows is a list of my personal projects. This list is 
                ordered from most to least recent.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Generative Documentation & Testing</strong> &mdash; NPM package that 
                    functions as a CLI tool using the GPT 3.5 API to improve your JavaScript and 
                    TypeScript code. It helps you write better code by automatically generating 
                    documentation, refactoring code to improve performance and maintainability, 
                    adding unit tests using Jest, and converting JavaScript code to TypeScript. 
                    At its peak, the package had about 700 weekly downloads. You can see the 
                    <a href="https://github.com/alexjdean/type-scriptor">GitHub page</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Generative Satire</strong> &mdash; Automated satirical news site monitoring 
                    recent events and generating Onion-style articles using LLMs; At its peak, 
                    the site had a viewership of about 1500 people per week. The application was 
                    built using a React frontend and a Node.js backend, with articles stored on a 
                    Firebase Realtime Database and multiple APIs used for image and content 
                    generation. The site is hosted on Google Cloud. You can see the 
                    <a href="https://chicagomoontimes.com/">website</a> and 
                    <a href="https://github.com/alexjdean/chicagomoontimes.com">GitHub page</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Read This to Me</strong> &mdash; Application that converts written text into 
                    audio from a wide variety of dialects, using the SpeechSynthesis Web API. The 
                    site was built using JavaScript and HTML/CSS. The site is hosted on GitHub 
                    Pages with a custom domain. You can see the 
                    <a href="https://readtext.me/">website</a> and 
                    <a href="https://github.com/alexjdean/readtext.me">GitHub page</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Language Discovery</strong> &mdash; Application that applies various 
                    similarity algorithms on various human language data sets. By languages, 
                    I'm referencing frequency dictionaries for human languages, which catalog 
                    how frequently a word is used in one language relative to another. I examine 
                    topics like the average word length and the most popular color in a given 
                    langauge. You can see the 
                    <a href="https://alexdean.io/language-discovery/vis/index.html">website</a>
