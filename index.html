            <h1>Alex Dean</h1>
        
            <p>I'm a software engineer interested in large-scale distributed machine learning 
                systems. I studied computer science at the University of Illinois 
                Urbana-Champaign.</p>
            
            <p>At Capital One, I work on developing and deploying NLP models for call 
                intent prediction, transcription, and sentiment analysis. I strongly believe in 
                the power of self-directed personal projects to expand your abilities. For more 
                information, see <a href="engineering.html">my projects</a> and 
                <a href="https://github.com/alexjdean">my GitHub</a>.</p>
