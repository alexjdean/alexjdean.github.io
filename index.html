            <h1>Alex Dean</h1>

            <p>
                I'm a software engineer at Amazon Web Services. I'm interested in large-scale 
                distributed machine learning systems. I studied computer science at the University 
                of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I live in Seattle.
            </p>

            <p>
                At AWS, I work on managing the exabyte-scale infrastructure for 
                <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-snapshots.html">EBS snapshots</a>. 
                Previously, I worked on ML infra at Capital One. I strongly believe in the power of 
                self-directed personal projects to expand your engineering abilities. You can see 
                <a href="engineering.html">my engineering page</a> 
                and <a href="https://github.com/alexjdean">my GitHub</a>.
            </p>

            <p>I enjoy doing mathematics and solving interesting problems. I'm broadly 
                interested in theoretical computer science, particularly graph-related algorithm 
                and optimization problems, as well as analytic number theory. For more information, see 
                <a href="research.html">my research</a> and 
                <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z9zyFCoAAAAJ">my 
                Google Scholar</a>.
            </p>

            <!-- <p>
                I'm also interested in the impact of communication technologies on modern society, and 
                the role of government in scientific research, building infrastructure, and fostering an
                engaged and active civic culture. You can see my thoughts and writings on these topics at 
                <a href="writing.html">my writing page</a>.
            </p> -->

            <p>
                In my spare time, I like to watch <a href="https://letterboxd.com/alexjdean/">movies</a>,
                do stand-up comedy, and play golf.
            </p>
