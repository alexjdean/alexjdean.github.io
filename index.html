            <h1>Alex Dean</h1>
        
            <p>
                I'm a software engineer at Amazon Web Services. I'm interested in large-scale 
                distributed machine learning systems. I studied computer science at the 
                University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I live in Seattle.
            </p>

            <p>
                I strongly believe in the power of self-directed personal projects to expand your 
                engineering abilities. For more information, see 
                <a href="engineering.html">my projects</a> and 
                <a href="https://github.com/alexjdean">my GitHub</a>.
            </p>

            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy doing mathematics and solving interesting problems. I'm broadly 
                interested in theoretical computer science, particularly graph-related algorithm 
                and optimization problems, as well as analytic number theory. For more information, see 
                <a href="research.html">my research</a> and 
                <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z9zyFCoAAAAJ">my 
                Google Scholar</a>.
