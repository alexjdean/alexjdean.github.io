                There's nothing quite like a book that changes how you see the world. There's 
                nothing quite like perceiving life through some unspoken lens, and then having 
                some elegant idea change that perception. Books like that are the stuff of magic.
            </p>

            <p>
                The purpose of this page is to serve as a resource for others hoping to be 
                transformed. For each year, I selected the top five books that have influenced me 
                the most. While my selections are susceptible to my inherent biases of what is 
                important, as well as my prevailing interests and attitudes of the time, I hope 
                this page will be useful for others willing to indulge their curiosities to the 
                furthest extent.
