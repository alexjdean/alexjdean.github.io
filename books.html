                There's nothing quite like a book that changes how you see the world. There's 
                nothing quite like perceiving life through some unspoken lens, and then having 
                some elegant idea change that perception. Books like that are the stuff of magic.
            </p>

            <p>
                The purpose of this page is to serve as a resource for others hoping to be 
                transformed. For each year, I selected the top five books that have influenced me 
                the most. While my selections are susceptible to my inherent biases of what is 
                important, as well as my prevailing interests and attitudes of the time, I hope 
                this page will be useful for others willing to indulge their curiosities to the 
                furthest extent.

                    examination of how, more and more, individuals in modern society interact with

                    into the thrill, terror, tyranny, and tragedy of antiquate Greek life, drawing

                    behind DARPA, the life of J. C. R. Licklider, and the development of the 
                    modern internet; This book provides an unusual glimpse into how government 
                    can uniquely build and accelerate the development of far-fetched new 
                    technologies.

                    this book is one of the most unique books I've ever read; It showcases the 
                    subtle and invisible triumphs and tragedies of mundane daily life,
                    making visible thoughts and feelings we frequently fail to notice.

                    cognitive biases we all subconsciously harbor and the myriad ways our perceptions 
                    misrepresent reality; Central to the book is the friendship between psychologists 
                    Amos Tvsersky and Daniel Kahneman, who uncover much of the research behind human 
                    judgement and decision-making.

                    camps during World War II, this book is about what allows humans to endure some 
                    of the harshest traumas and realities imaginable; Their enduring connection to the
                    lives they left behind plays an important role.

                    the brain stores and reconstructs information, the research behind 
                    it (the brain uses <i>references frames</i> through thousands of <i>cortical columns</i>!), 
                    connections to recent developments in artificial intelligence, and the possibility of merging 
                    human brains with computers.

                    the innate human drive to help others, the moral questions raised in the pursuit 
                    of altruism, the narrative blankets we cling to, and what happens in a world where 
                    pure altruism is taken to its logical ends.

                    my favorite President; This book tells the wonderful story of his ascent, his many setbacks 
                    and tragedies, his quintessential boundless energy, and what it meant to be an ambitious 
                    public servant at the turn of the 20th century.
